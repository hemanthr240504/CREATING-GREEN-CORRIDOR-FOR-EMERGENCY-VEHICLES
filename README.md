## 🎯 Overview

The Green Corridor Emergency Vehicle Detection System uses state-of-the-art computer vision (YOLOv8) to detect ambulances in real-time through camera feeds or uploaded media. When an ambulance is detected, the system automatically activates a "green corridor" by simulating traffic signal changes along the route to the nearest hospital, potentially saving critical minutes in emergency situations.

### Key Highlights

- **Real-time Detection**: Live camera feed processing with instant ambulance detection
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic calculation of optimal routes to nearest hospitals using OSRM
- **Traffic Signal Control**: Automated green corridor activation along emergency routes
- **Multi-modal Input**: Supports live camera, image uploads, and video processing
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of detections, traffic signals, and emergency status
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Interactive map showing ambulance location, hospitals, and active routes
